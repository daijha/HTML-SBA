        This is called a violin bow. Its how players "pull" the sound out of the
        instrument. It is traditionally made out of horse hair and wood. Today
        you can find bows made out of other more durable materials like carbon
        fiber.

        This is called rosin. its made from tree sap and so it is sticky. This
        is applied to the bow to cause friction on the strings, causing them to
        vibrate (vibration = sound). There are a variety of strengths that you
        can choose from. They range in color from light to dark.

        is a shoulder rest. It helps to prop up the instrument so its easier to
        play. This is optional to use. It depends on the build of the player.

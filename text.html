        <br />This is a violin! It is a four-stringed instrument that is a
        descendant from the lute family. No one really knows the exact orgins of
        the violin but it is said that they were first built in Italy in the
        16th century. A popular opinion is that italian, german, and french
        violins are the instruments that have the best sound and quality.

        <br />The violin did not always look like how does today. It
        went through a few makeovers before looking so nice. Previous
        violins did not have the same shape, number of strings, and even the
        holes on the font of the body. Here are some to look at for comparison.

        The accessories were also made out of other materials that were more
        "natural". For example, the strings today are made out of some kind core
        ( nylon,steel or synthetic core), and they are wrapped with aluminum,
        nickel, gold or steel! Each material changes the kind of sound the violin makes.
        Previously the strings were only made out of the guts of sheep or goats.
        People called this kind of string "cat gut" at the time which was short for cattle
        gut. Not to be mixed up with actual kittens!

        experimental styles.

Project Name: SBA SUBMISSION FOR MODULE 307

Description: This is a 3 page small website talking about random violin facts. it was made by a musician with entry level HTML and CSS skills. This is a submission for a test, so the musician in question really tried to flex thier muscles to see how much they retained. To this day, they are sitting somewhere with their fingers crossed, hoping it was enough...

How To Use: Read everything if you care to, and hover around to see some entry-level transitions. Enjoy yourself! # HTML-SBA
